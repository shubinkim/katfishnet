# Detecting LLM-Generated Korean Text through Linguistic Feature Analysis (ACL 2025 Main)

[**📖 Paper**](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1030/)

## Overview

We introduce the first benchmark dataset **KatFish** for detecting Korean text generated by large language models (LLMs). As LLMs become increasingly capable of producing fluent and coherent text, distinguishing machine-generated content from human-written text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, and maintaining ethical research standards. We also propose a specialized detection method—**KatFishNet**—that exploits linguistic features unique to the Korean language.

## Motivation

The explosive growth of LLMs has blurred the line between human and machine-generated text. While much research has focused on English, Korean presents its own set of challenges:
- **Flexible Word Spacing:** Korean allows significant variability in spacing.
- **Rich Morphological Structure & Complex POS Patterns:** The language’s extensive system of postpositions, verb endings, and inflections produces a wide array of syntactic constructions.
- **Distinctive Punctuation Usage:** Korean punctuation—especially the use of commas—differs from that of English, reflecting subtle stylistic and grammatical preferences.

These characteristics demand a language-specific approach for detecting LLM-generated text. We address this gap by systematically analyzing linguistic features that capture these nuances.

## KatFish Dataset

The KatFish dataset is assembled from Korean texts spanning three major genres:

- **Essay:** Argumentative essays collected from educational corpora, covering diverse topics across elementary, middle, and high school levels. Detailed analyses include topic distributions and statistics segmented by education level.
- **Poetry:** Free-form creative poems that capture the expressive and often unconventional style of Korean poetry. The dataset includes works from various age groups, reflecting differences in stylistic trends.
- **Paper Abstract:** Concise summaries of academic papers characterized by formal language, technical terms, and structured presentation.

For each genre, the dataset comprises:
- **Human-Written Texts:** Sourced from reputable public corpora and manually curated to ensure quality.
- **LLM-Generated Texts:** Produced using a combination of two commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Solar) and two open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen2 and Llama3.1). Each text is generated with carefully designed prompts that mirror the style expected for that genre.

## KatFishNet: The Detection Method

**KatFishNet** is a machine learning–based detector that leverages three primary linguistic feature groups, designed specifically to capture the stylistic discrepancies between human and LLM-generated Korean text:

1. **Word Spacing Patterns**  
   - **Analysis:** Examines the distribution of spaces around bound nouns (BN) and auxiliary predicate elements (VX).  
   - **Metrics:** Computes ratios such as the MMN-BN Space Ratio and BN Space Ratio, which quantify how consistently text adheres to standard spacing rules.

2. **POS N-gram Diversity**  
   - **Analysis:** Measures the diversity of part-of-speech (POS) n-grams, ranging from unigrams up to pentagrams.  
   - **Insight:** Human text typically exhibits a richer variety of syntactic patterns compared to LLM-generated text, which tends to repeat common structures.

3. **Comma Usage Patterns**  
   - **Analysis:** Investigates the frequency and positional characteristics of commas, along with the diversity of POS combinations immediately surrounding them.
   - **Metrics:** Includes measures such as Comma Inclusion Rate, Average Comma Usage Rate, Relative Position of Comma, and POS Diversity before and after commas.
  
By extracting and concatenating these feature vectors, KatFishNet trains lightweight classifiers (using methods like logistic regression, random forests, or support vector machines) to effectively distinguish between human-written and machine-generated text.

## OOD Evaluation - Unseen LLMs
### Objective
To evaluate the generalization ability of detection methods, we conduct **out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation** by testing the model’s performance on texts generated by **unseen LLMs**. Since new LLMs frequently emerge with distinct generation patterns, a robust detection model should maintain its accuracy even when faced with previously unseen text sources.

### Methodology
- We split the **human-written text** into an **8:2 ratio**, using **80%** for training and reserving **20%** for evaluation.
- **GPT-4o** is used as the primary training LLM-generated dataset.
- For testing, we evaluate against text generated by **Solar, Qwen2, and Llama3.1**.
- The test dataset is structured into three distinct sets, each containing text from one of the unseen LLMs along with the reserved **20% human-written text**.
- **Zero-shot classification setting**: All detection models are tested on LLM-generated text they have never encountered during training.

Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres. By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78{\%} higher AUC-ROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/katfishnet."
